** This file is an amalgamation of many separate C source files from SQLite

** translation unit.
**
** This file is all you need to compile SQLite.  To use SQLite in other

** the programming interface to the SQLite library.  (If you do not have 
** the "sqlite3.h" header file at hand, you will find a copy embedded within
** the text of this file.  Search for "Begin file sqlite3.h" to find the start
** of the embedded sqlite3.h header file.) Additional code files may be needed
** if you want a wrapper to interface SQLite with your choice of programming
** language. The code for the "sqlite3" command-line shell is also in a
** separate file. This file contains only code for the core SQLite library.

** CAPI3REF: Device Characteristics
**
** The xDeviceCharacteristics method of the [sqlite3_io_methods]
** object returns an integer which is a vector of these
** bit values expressing I/O characteristics of the mass storage
** device that holds the file that the [sqlite3_io_methods]
** refers to.
**
** The SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC property means that all writes of
** any size are atomic.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMICnnn values
** mean that writes of blocks that are nnn bytes in size and
** are aligned to an address which is an integer multiple of
** nnn are atomic.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_SAFE_APPEND value means
** that when data is appended to a file, the data is appended
** first then the size of the file is extended, never the other
** way around.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_SEQUENTIAL property means that
** information is written to disk in the same order as calls
** to xWrite().  The SQLITE_IOCAP_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE property means that
** after reboot following a crash or power loss, the only bytes in a
** file that were written at the application level might have changed
** and that adjacent bytes, even bytes within the same sector are
** guaranteed to be unchanged.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_UNDELETABLE_WHEN_OPEN
** flag indicate that a file cannot be deleted when open.  The
** SQLITE_IOCAP_IMMUTABLE flag indicates that the file is on
** read-only media and cannot be changed even by processes with
** elevated privileges.
