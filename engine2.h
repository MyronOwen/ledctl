** This header file defines the interface that the SQLite library
** presents to client programs.  If a C-function, structure, datatype,
** or constant definition does not appear in this file, then it is
** not a published API of SQLite, is subject to change without
** notice, and should not be referenced by programs that use SQLite.
**
** Some of the definitions that are in this file are marked as
** "experimental".  Experimental interfaces are normally new
** features recently added to SQLite.  We do not anticipate changes
** to experimental interfaces but reserve the right to make minor changes
** if experience from use "in the wild" suggest such changes are prudent.
**
** The official C-language API documentation for SQLite is derived
** from comments in this file.  This file is the authoritative source
** on how SQLite interfaces are suppose to operate.
**
** The name of this file under configuration management is "sqlite.h.in".
** The makefile makes some minor changes to this file (such as inserting
** the version number) and changes its name to "sqlite3.h" as
** part of the build process.

** evaluates to a string literal that is the SQLite version in the
** format "X.Y.Z" where X is the major version number (always 3 for

** The SQLITE_VERSION_NUMBER for any given release of SQLite will also
** be larger than the release from which it is derived.  Either Y will

** within its configuration management system.  ^The SQLITE_SOURCE_ID
** string contains the date and time of the check-in (UTC) and an SHA1
** hash of the entire source tree.
